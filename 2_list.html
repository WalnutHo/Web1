    <h1>HTML 이란 무엇인가?</h1>

    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
      <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. Web
      browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
      and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
      a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
      the document.

      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into
      the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets.
